Stack Data Structures

This project implements two stack data structures: one using arrays and another using linked lists. 
It includes functionalities to create, manipulate, and test stacks, as well as check for palindromes 
using these stacks.

Features
Array-Based Stack: Implements stack operations (push, pop, peek, delete) using an array.
Linked List-Based Stack: Implements stack operations using a linked list.
Palindrome Checker: Uses both stack implementations to determine if a given string is a palindrome.
Comprehensive Testing: Demonstrates stack operations and palindrome checking with various test cases.
